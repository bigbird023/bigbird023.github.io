## Start Here

- Beginners guide: [Git for Beginners](beginners/)
- Intermediate topics: [Git for Intermediate](git-for-intermediate/)

## Notes

- Squash merge: linear history by combining commits
- Rebase + fast-forward: replay commits for linear history
- Semi-linear: combine rebase + merge to keep important branches visible
