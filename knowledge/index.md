# Knowledge Hub

This section collects the technical knowledge, evaluations, and processes I've gathered and curated. It's organized by topic so it's easy to browse, review, and contribute.

## Evaluation

- [DAR (Vendor) evaluation methodology](/knowledge/evaluation/DAR) — guidance, scoring rubric, and spreadsheet templates.

## Diagrams

 - [Draw.io / diagrams.net](/knowledge/diagrams/drawio) — drag-and-drop editor for architecture, network, and deployment diagrams (XML source, good for Git).
 - [Excalidraw](/knowledge/diagrams/excalidraw) — collaborative, sketch-style whiteboard for brainstorming and quick flows; exportable as SVG/PNG.
 - [Mindmaps](/knowledge/diagrams/mindmap) — capture hierarchical ideas and plan projects; exports to OPML/Markdown for import into notes/tasks.
 - [PlantUML](/knowledge/diagrams/plantuml) — text-driven diagrams (sequence, class, component) for reproducible, source-controlled diagrams.

## [SecDevOps](/knowledge/secdevops/)
