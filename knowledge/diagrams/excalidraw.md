# Excalidraw â€” Sketchy, collaborative diagrams

Excalidraw is a lightweight, free, open-source whiteboard and sketching tool that emphasizes speed and collaboration. Its hand-drawn aesthetic makes diagrams approachable for brainstorming, architecture sketches, and whiteboarding artifacts.

## When to use Excalidraw

- You want fast, informal diagrams for early-stage design or team whiteboarding.
- You prefer collaborative, real-time editing with simple export options.
- You want a visual style that communicates "draft" or "working notes" rather than polished final diagrams.

## Quickstart

1. Open https://excalidraw.com/ or enable Excalidraw in Obsidian / other editors via plugins.
2. Use the shape tools and freehand drawing to capture ideas quickly.
3. Export to PNG/SVG or save the Excalidraw JSON for re-editing.

## Great example uses

- Brainstorm session outputs and design notes
- User journey sketches and flows
- Low-fidelity UI wireframes (quick iteration)
- Annotated diagrams for team discussions (use arrows and labels)

## Collaboration tips

- Use the live collaboration link or share the file to allow team members to edit simultaneously.
- For versioning, export a PNG/SVG snapshot into PRs and keep the `.excalidraw` JSON in the repo for re-editing.

## Exporting & embedding

- SVG exports are supported and can be inlined in Markdown or HTML. SVG preserves vector quality.
- Save the JSON to keep the original editable source.

## Helpful resources

- Excalidraw website: https://excalidraw.com/
