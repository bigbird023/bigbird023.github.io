# Mindmaps — capture structure and relationships

Mindmaps are ideal for capturing hierarchical ideas, brainstorming, and planning. Several tools support mindmaps (free and paid): MindMup, FreeMind, XMind, and many note apps include mindmap plugins.

## When to use a mindmap

- You need to map relationships and hierarchies quickly (features, research topics, project scope).
- You want to take notes in a non-linear fashion and then convert them into linear artifacts.

## Quickstart

1. Pick a mindmap tool (MindMup for lightweight browser-based use; XMind for richer export options).
2. Create a central topic and add branches for main categories.
3. Use colors and icons to denote status, priority, or team ownership.

## Great example uses

- Project scoping and feature breakdowns
- Research topic organization and literature maps
- Meeting notes captured as a mindmap then converted to tasks

## Export & integration tips

- Export to PNG/SVG for documentation.
- Many mindmap tools export to OPML or Markdown lists — use these exports to import into note apps or task trackers.
