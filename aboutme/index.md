# About Me — Craig P. Benner — Senior Software Engineer (Technical Profile)

I am a Senior Software Engineer with 20+ years of experience building and operating mission-critical business systems. My work spans software architecture, database design and administration, release engineering, and data analytics. I combine pragmatic engineering with process-driven practices (CI/CD, automated testing, reproducible deployments) to reduce risk and accelerate delivery.

## Professional Summary

Experienced Systems Developer, Application Developer, Database Administrator, Data Analyst, and Project Manager with a strong track record delivering robust business applications across multiple industries. I specialize in web systems and database design (Oracle, MS-SQL Server, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB) that integrate with enterprise platforms. I focus on reliability, scalability, and automating repeatable processes.

I have a particular interest in production control and release automation. Recent work has involved implementing formal CI/CD pipelines and build systems using GitLab, Jenkins, Bamboo, and other integrated tools to move code safely from development into production. I regularly work with version control (Git, SVN), build automation, continuous integration, and deployment tooling.

- DevOps & Release Engineering — CI/CD pipelines, build systems, artifact management, and deployment automation.
- Programming & Automation — object-oriented development, scripting (Bash, Python), and automation using Ansible and similar tools.
- Web & Microservices — RESTful APIs, microservices design, and modern web application patterns.
- Analytics & Operational Intelligence — data extraction, transformation, reporting and MI (Management Information) practices.

## Selected Tools & Technologies

- Languages: Python, SQL, Java (familiar)
- Databases: Oracle, MS-SQL Server, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB
- CI/CD & Build: GitLab CI, Jenkins, Atlassian Bamboo, GitHub Actions
- Containerization & Orchestration: Docker, Kubernetes (conceptual)
- Automation: Ansible, Bash scripting

## Selected Projects (high level)

- Automated fleet provisioning — built an Ansible-driven provisioning pipeline integrated with configuration management and monitoring.
- CI/CD modernization — introduced GitLab CI/Jenkins pipelines with automated testing, artifact builds, and canary deployments.

## Professional Approach

I believe in making systems observable, automatable, and repeatable. I document runbooks and processes, and I collaborate with cross-functional teams to minimize risk during deployments. I enjoy mentoring engineers on architecture, testing, and production readiness.
