# Projects Hub

This section collects any projects that I have the capability of posting publicly.

## GoLang Projects

- [google photos downloader](https://github.com/bigbird023/gphotos) — I started developing this before google provided a way to download all photos from an account.  It is a golang commandline capable of downloading google photos from your account.

## Ansible Projects

- [Ansible Workstation Setup for Development](https://github.com/bigbird023/workstation_setup) - I replicated this concept from another coworker, but I tweaked it for my development needs.  I'm able to step thru some process and then automatically install all pieces of software I want to do development.
